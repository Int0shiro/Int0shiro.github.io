		<h1>What is display calibration?</h1>
		Monitor or display calibration is the process of adjusting screen colors to the standards set by the RGB (red, green, blue) color model. This model was created in the nineteenth century, but has become the standard for most televisions and computers. Since almost every screen works using the RGB model, proper calibration is the best guarantee that your work will look exactly the way you intended it to on all screens.
